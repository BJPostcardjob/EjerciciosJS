Exercise #3
Write while loops to do the following:

– Repeatedly print the value of the variable xValue, decreasing it by 0.5 each time,
as long as xValue remains positive.
- Print all the odd numbers between 1 - 100.
- Write a method with a while loop to print 1 through n in square brackets. 
For example, if n = 6 print [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
- Write a method with a while loop that computes the sum of first n positive integers: 
sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n
Examples:
n = 5 sum = 15
n = 19 sum = 190

const cola = ['Sofia', 'David', 'Juan'];
cola.push('Sara', 'Augustin');
cola.shift();
cola.push('Sara', 'Augustin');
cola.shift();
cola.splice(2, 0, 'Renata');
cola.push('Elena');

// Cola = es fila pero con traducción arcaica
